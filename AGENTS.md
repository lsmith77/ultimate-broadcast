# AGENTS.md

Guidance for coding agents working on the broadcast overlays. Keep this file short; the reasoning lives in `docs/`.

## Project overview

Broadcast graphics for Ultimate tournaments, extending Live! by BULA (which runs on UltiOrganizer 4). Four surfaces: the **scoreboard** bug, the **studio** (a full-frame stage plus the page that controls it), the **commentator** second screen, and **match control** — the score and clock, kept from a phone. See `docs/README.md`.

Installed by dropping this directory into `live/overlays/` of a Live! install. It is its own repository; the host is not.

## Three hard constraints

These are not preferences. Breaking any of them breaks the project's reason to exist.

1. **Never edit a file that Live! ships.** `live/bin/update-from-github.sh` unzips a release over the tree without deleting extra files. A local patch to Live!'s own code disappears at the worst possible moment — mid-tournament, on upgrade, silently. Everything we write lives under `live/overlays/`.
2. **No overlay reads the database.** Everything goes through `live/api`. This is what makes the directory portable and what keeps us off Live!'s internals. `docs/STUDIO.md` §3.4 contemplates one exception for per-game block data; it is marked open, and it is not a precedent.
3. **The only file outside this directory is the host's root `.htaccess`**, and only for the optional `/s/` and `/c/` short URLs. It ships as `install/root-htaccess-snippet.conf` for pasting — `.htaccess` has no import mechanism, so `IncludeOptional` is not an option (Apache errors and 500s every request under that directory).

## Layout

Runtime code sits at the top level, because a routed view's path *is* its URL — moving `scoreboard.php` into a subdirectory changes `?view=live/overlays/scoreboard`.

| path | what |
|---|---|
| `scoreboard.php` `stage.php` `commentator.php` `index.php` | routed pages |
| `show.php` `colors.php` `lines.php` `notes.php` `possession.php` | routed JSON endpoints |
| `app.php` `login.php` | the standalone front controller and its administrator login. Both are inert under UltiOrganizer — `login.php` 404s when Live! is present, because the host owns that session |
| `shared/` | CSS, the PHP stores behind those endpoints, and the JS modules every surface shares: `possession.js` `stoppage.js` `field.js` `ratio.js` `tracking.js` `provider.js` `declared.js` `lineup.js` `timeouts.js` `secret.js` `csv.js` `bios.js`, plus `auth.php` and `mode.php` |
| `conf/` | operator state written by the web server — **gitignored** |
| `logos/` | per-installation team logos — **contents gitignored** |
| `fixtures/payloads/` | recorded API responses, so pages can render with no host — see `docs/STANDALONE.md` §8 |
| `docs/` `tests/` `fixtures/` `install/` | not served to viewers |

`tests/selftest.php` is still a routed page (`?view=live/overlays/tests/selftest`) because it must be loadable by the switcher it diagnoses.

## Architecture rules

- **Routing:** every page checks `UO_ROUTED_VIEW` and 404s otherwise, so a direct request to a `.php` file returns nothing.
- **Two polls, deliberately different.** Show state is a *static* `conf/show.json` at ~1s, because an operator's click must feel instant. Game data follows `meta.expires_timestamp` (30s for a live game). Do not route show state through PHP and do not poll the API faster — the cache life is the server telling you when it will have news.
- **One renderer, never two.** The scoreboard's `?at=<seconds>&goals=<n>&phase=…` draws a single deterministic frame for post-production; it works by handing the existing `render()` a truncated payload, not by reimplementing anything. Alignment between a video and a game lives outside the overlay entirely — some tournaments record no goal times at all, so the caller decides which goals have happened and the overlay just draws it.
- **Arm, then show.** A card fetches, loads and decodes everything it needs *before* it is revealed. `img.decode()`, not `onload`. A card that appears while an asset is still loading pops in half-drawn, on air.
- **Placement is non-exclusive; visibility is exclusive per slot.** Several cards may be *placed* in one position, armed and waiting; at most one may be *on air*. Switching one on takes the slot from the other.
- **The store is the authority, not the UI.** `shared/show.php` drops unknown cards, cards in slots they do not fit, second-visible-in-a-slot, and anything under a fullscreen takeover. Never enforce a rule only in `index.php`.
- **State that belongs to a game is stored per game.** A tournament runs several fields at once, so a single shared document lets one field silently destroy another's data and put it on the wrong scoreboard — both demonstrated before the possession store was keyed by game. Prefer a shape where the mistake cannot be written over a guard that every future reader has to remember.
- **`LOCK_EX` on a temp file locks nothing.** The stores write via temp-file-and-rename, which gives *readers* atomicity — never half a document — and no mutual exclusion whatever, because each writer holds the lock on its own private temp file. A read-modify-write needs `flock` on a shared lock file across the whole cycle. `show.php`, `colors.php`, `possession.php` and `notes.php` have one; **`lines.php` does not**, and its `saveTeam()` is a read-modify-write — two commentators saving lines for different teams in the same moment can still lose one of them. Known gap, not a design decision.
- **Writes use optimistic locking.** Send the `rev` you read; the store rejects a stale one with 409 and returns current state to reapply.
- **Never drop a write because it arrived too soon. Drop one that would change nothing.** A time-based throttle that returns success is a silent revert: the state was never stored, so the next poll undoes the caller's change while the surface that made it goes on showing it. `filemtime()` has one-second granularity, so any such window is unpredictable up to a second rather than the fraction it looks like. This has now been written twice and found twice — in `notes.php`, then again in `lines.php`, where it swallowed a substitution made moments after a pick. Compare content instead.
- **One value, one function.** `lineSize()` and `ratioPair()` were two derivations of the same fact and drifted: with no declared size, a shared `3MMP/2FMP` made the cap 5 while the pair stayed seven-a-side, so the panel contradicted the count beside it. If two functions must agree, make one call the other rather than deriving in parallel.
- **A fact declared at a desk goes through `shared/declared.js`.** Anything UltiOrganizer does not record and somebody watching declares — the first point's ratio, players per side — is shared through the room when the desk is linked, kept on the screen when it is not, and replaced by a shared value with a one-shot note. That was seven functions written twice before it was written once; add a config, not a third copy.
- **New state declares what clears it.** This page holds state with several lifetimes, and `resetFor()` in `commentator.php` names them: a point ending, a manual line clear, a change of room. Two bugs came from three handlers each deciding independently — a substitution prompt outliving its point, and a room change leaving the previous room's injuries marked on a roster. Adding a field means adding it to that list, or deliberately not.
- **Never block a click to prevent a consequence — show the consequence first.** Displacing a card is usually intended. Warn on hover, on the card that would lose; do not disable.

## What the data actually supports

Checked against real payloads, not assumed. `docs/STUDIO.md` §3 is the full account; these are the traps.

- **Turnovers do not exist.** No table, anywhere. A throwaway or a drop leaves no trace. Anything needing possession is impossible, not merely hard.
- **Blocks arrive as `deftotal`** on the `entity=teams` roster row, and only when the `ShowDefenseStats` system setting is on — it ships off. Completed games only. There is no per-game block list in any payload.
- **Absent is not zero.** A missing field means "this installation does not track this"; a present `0` means "none yet". Test for presence, not truthiness. A column of zeros pretending to be a ranking is worse than no column.
- **`TeamScoreBoardWithDefenses()` does not return `totalavg`.** Anything reading it silently becomes zero the moment an admin enables defence stats. Derive from `total` and `games`.
- **Holds and breaks are the same fact twice** — they sum to total points. Lead with breaks.
- **`seasoninfo.type` is a SURFACE, not a size.** It says outdoor, indoor or beach. Players per side is recorded nowhere — not on `uo_game`, `uo_pool`, `uo_series` or `uo_season`, and in no payload — so 7 and 5 are conventions inferred from the surface, and a 6v6 or 4v4 game is invisible. It has to be declared by hand (`COMMENTATOR.md` §6b).

## Code style

- **PHP:** match the surrounding code. There is no formatter configured in this repo; the host project uses PER-CS 2.0 and following it keeps the two consistent. `php -l` every file you touch.
- **Client JS: the baseline is Live!'s baseline, which is Chrome 80+.** Live!'s own frontend is a Vite bundle loaded as `<script type="module">` and uses nullish coalescing (`??`, 125 occurrences) and optional chaining (`?.`) in the entry chunk every page pulls in — including its `TVScreenPage` route, the vendor's own analogue of these overlays. A browser that cannot run that shows nothing at all for Live!, so any device on which Live! works can run modern JavaScript.
  - **The two tiers may diverge, deliberately.** A scoreboard or stage runs on an embedded engine nobody can inspect, has no keyboard, and cannot be refreshed while it is on air: it stays conservative and dependency-free. The Studio, the commentary page and anything like them run on a laptop or a phone somebody is holding, where the browser is a stated requirement and a reload is free — those may use modern JavaScript and take dependencies. What must not change is that there is **no build step**: ES modules and vendored dependencies keep "the directory is the installation", which `docs/STANDALONE.md` §6 depends on. And a module in `shared/` loaded by both tiers stays dependency-free, because a library added for the desk that arrives on the scoreboard has moved the floor on the one device nobody can debug. See `docs/RELAY.md` §7.
  - The page `<script>` blocks here are written ES5-style — `var` and `function`, no arrow functions or template literals. That is **existing convention, not a compatibility requirement**: match it when editing those files so a diff reads consistently, but do not treat it as a constraint, and do not rewrite `shared/overlay-client.js` (modern, `async`/`await`, `?.`) to match. It is no more demanding than Live! already is.
  - **What is genuinely unverified is the hardware, not the syntax.** OBS moved off CEF 75 at 27.2.3 and current releases ship Chromium 95 or newer, but Magewell and Yolobox publish nothing about their embedded engines. `tests/selftest.php` exists to answer that on the device, and it is worth running before a first broadcast — the failure it detects is not "an overlay looks wrong" but "an overlay never updates".
- **CSS:** colours go through the tokens in the `:root` blocks, never inline literals. Adding a hard-coded hex breaks theming.
- **Markdown: never hard-wrap.** One line per paragraph, list item, and list-item continuation, however long. Blank lines still separate blocks. Hard wraps make a one-word edit reflow a whole paragraph and turn diffs to noise. When unwrapping an existing file, preserve the leading indent of a list-item continuation or it breaks out of the item and restarts the numbering.

## Language

- **Always MMP and FMP, never M and F.** Matching male player and matching female player. The categories describe who a player matches up against, not who they are, and the shortened form quietly turns a matchup rule into a statement about people. UltiOrganizer's own printed scoresheet still says "4M/3F"; write ratios as `4MMP/3FMP`, which is the same rule stated properly. The store validates the format, so the short form is rejected rather than silently accepted.
- **Name one side of a ratio, not both.** Write `4MMP`, not `4MMP/3FMP`. On a seven-a-side line four MMP means three FMP and there is nothing else it could be, so the second half is spent saying what the reader already knows — and, more importantly, writing both halves forces a decision about which comes first. There is no good answer to that question, and no reason to answer it: naming the majority side avoids putting either category ahead of the other every time a ratio appears on screen. Same for five-a-side: `3MMP` is 3MMP/2FMP.
  - The *stored* value keeps both halves (`4MMP/3FMP`), because it is a data format with a validator rather than something anybody reads. `Ratio.short()` in `shared/ratio.js` turns it into the displayed form; use it everywhere a ratio reaches a screen. That module also owns the A-B-B-A pattern, the pair for a season type, and the mixed-division test — they were duplicated between the commentator page and the progression card, which is exactly how the card came to be printing the long form after the commentator had moved to the short one.
- Say what a control switches on, not what one of its outputs is called. "Break chance" named a single graphic while the toggle actually enables possession tracking, which also feeds clean holds, the turnover count and conversion figures.

## Security

- **`lines.php` and `notes.php` are the only unauthenticated writes in the project.** The room code is a namespace, not a credential — nothing there reaches a viewer. Everything else that writes is behind `Overlays\Auth::isAdmin()`, which is one function with two answers: Live!'s admin session when there is a Live!, and a session this project sets against a hash in `conf/` when there is not. Ask it; never ask `SeasonAccess` directly.
- **A room code is never on permanent display.** `shared/secret.js` masks the code field on both the commentator page and the Studio, revealing on demand and re-masking after 30s. A namespace nobody can guess is what the unauthenticated stores rest on, and a five-character code printed on a booth screen all day is not unguessable — it is published. The auto-hide is the load-bearing part: "reveal, read it out, forget to hide it" is the actual failure mode. It also retires a whole class of argument — once the auto-hide makes "left revealed" unreachable, no feature can be justified by "otherwise they will leave it revealed". That reasoning is what put a redundant auto-reveal on the Studio's New code button.
- **`notes.php` holds personal data, which none of the other stores do.** It is a commentator's own notes about named players — plus, in the same entries, self-declared identity fields (nickname, pronouns, name pronunciation), of which pronouns are the most sensitive thing this project stores — so three things are load-bearing rather than tidy: `conf/` stays default-closed so a note room is never a servable file, the rooms expire after 14 days, and every note records who wrote it. A guessed line room exposes a line-up; a guessed note room exposes what a desk wrote about people. Same mechanism, larger consequence. `docs/COMMENTATOR.md` §5a.
- **Bound what the attacker controls, not what a caller is expected to send.** Both original caps in `lines.php` were wrong this way: rooms-per-game bounded nothing because game ids are unvalidated integers, and players-per-team bounded nothing because teams-per-room was uncapped. `docs/COMMENTATOR.md` §6 records both.
- **Encode on output.** `json_encode` with `JSON_HEX_TAG | JSON_HEX_AMP` into `<script>`, `htmlspecialchars(..., ENT_QUOTES)` into markup, integers cast. `htmlspecialchars` does *not* protect a CSS context — validate those values instead.
- **Whitelist every URL parameter** against a fixed list or a regex. Never interpolate one into a class attribute or a path.
- **`conf/` is default-closed** in `.htaccess` with `show.json` allowlisted. Anything new dropped in there is not public unless you say so.

## Accessibility and the daylight rule

The broadcast surfaces (`scoreboard`, `stage`) are rendered to video and have no interactive audience. The **studio** and **commentator** pages are real UIs used by people, and are held to real standards.

- **The commentator page defaults to a light, high-contrast theme, and that is not a style choice.** It is used at the side of a pitch. A screen cannot out-emit the sun, so under a bright sky a dark interface stops being dark — the glass becomes a mirror. Every text pair in the day theme measures **7:1 or better** (AAA). Night is available for a booth and is remembered per device.
- **Do not use `prefers-color-scheme` for this.** It reports what someone chose for their OS months ago, indoors. It says nothing about whether the sun is on the screen now.
- Structure carries meaning that position cannot: headings, `aria-labelledby` from panels to the header that names them, `aria-pressed` on toggles, `role="dialog"` with managed focus. The commentator header names each team once *visually*; a screen reader gets the same naming structurally.
- Never right-align by reversing DOM nodes — the content is then read backwards. Use `flex-direction: row-reverse`.
- **Colour is never the only carrier of a distinction, and the tints are proof of why.** FMP and violet MMP measure **1.05:1 against each other** in daylight, and red-green colour blindness collapses what hue difference remains to nothing (1.01:1 simulated). That is acceptable *because* the term is always written next to the tint and the picker groups by matching structurally. Anything the tint alone would say is a thing a commentator cannot read. Off-injured follows the same rule: the word INJ, a rule struck through the chip, and a dashed edge, each sufficient alone.
- **Measure the tints too, not only the body text.** The FMP tag sat at 6.73:1 — under this page's own AAA bar — for as long as it did because the contrast test enumerated text pairs and never covered the matching tints. A new coloured label earns a line in that test.

## Known open risk

**Diagnostics are painted onto the broadcast canvas.** A wrong game id, or five consecutive failed polls, replaces the scoreboard with white error text over the live picture. Useful on a laptop during setup, unacceptable once the source is live, and the page cannot tell the two apart. Unresolved by choice — see `docs/STUDIO.md` §11 for the three options.

## Every feature ships with docs and a test

Not a nicety here, for two reasons specific to this project.

**Docs, because the reasoning is the deliverable.** Most of what these documents record is *why* — which upstream field does not exist, which number cannot be claimed, which plausible approach was measured and found wrong. None of that survives in the code, and re-deriving it costs what it cost the first time. A feature landing without its reasoning written down is a feature that will be re-litigated.

**A test, because the failure mode is on air.** These surfaces are watched live by people who cannot refresh, and the characteristic bug is not a crash but a graphic quietly asserting something untrue — a tab outliving its point, a rate without its denominator, a field-following overlay silently showing the wrong game. Those look completely normal in a screenshot. `tests/e2e/derived.spec.js` is the model: it asserts as hard on what a feature *refuses* to claim as on what it shows.

**And put a PROTOCOL there too, not only a derivation.** Two of them, and the split is worth knowing. `shared/tracking.js` holds the one way to talk to **this project's own** collected-facts store — every write, plus its response handling. `shared/provider.js` holds the one way to **read Live!**: the URL for each entity and the API's error contract.

Both exist because the same protocol had been written more than once. Tracking was `readJson`, `setDefence`, `toggleStoppage` and `correct` duplicated between the Studio and the commentator page. The read side was worse: eighteen entity reads across four files, and the response contract in three places, where the copies had already drifted — only one distinguished a fatal failure from a transient one, which is a scoreboard that stops on a bad game id versus one that retries it for a broadcast.

**Put a derivation in `shared/` and test it there.** Anything that decides what goes on air from data — the possession log, the field lookup, the stoppage window — is a pure function, and a pure function tested directly is worth more than the same logic tested through a page. Testing the stoppage window through the browser meant moving the game clock and losing to Live!'s 30-second payload cache: one run asked for a moment 20 seconds into a timeout and was served one 131 seconds in, measuring the previous clock while appearing to measure this one. Moved into `shared/stoppage.js` and tested directly, the same suite immediately found a real bug — the window picked the event with the greatest timestamp rather than the last one that had happened, which put a timeout on a post-production frame eighteen minutes before it was called. Keep one browser test for the wiring; test the logic where it lives.

**Measure in one coordinate space, and say which.** `.stage-canvas` carries a CSS transform, so an element inside it reports scaled viewport pixels while an element inside a card's iframe reports canvas pixels. Comparing the two agrees only in a window exactly 1920 CSS px wide — which is how the tournament logo came to sit on top of the scoreboard everywhere except a full-size browser, and why the test that should have caught it did not.

Modules in `shared/` publish to `window` **and** `module.exports`, because they are loaded both ways. Do not rely on top-level `this`: it is `module.exports` under plain CommonJS but `undefined` under the loader Playwright uses, and it fails at import rather than at use.

**Prefer a test that cannot pass for the wrong reason.** A regression test for a timing bug is a coin toss unless it controls the timing: the line-store throttle reproduced about one run in three until each attempt was aligned to a second boundary, which is where `filemtime()`'s granularity actually bites. Before trusting a new regression test, put the bug back and watch it fail — twice this session a test that looked right passed against the defect it was written for.

**A test must set the state it asserts on.** The suite writes to the files a broadcast reads, so it begins from whatever the last run left — and `tests/global-setup.js` now deliberately seeds a messy stage so that dependence fails immediately instead of months later. Eight tests here had quietly stopped testing anything this way: measuring whatever cards happened to be placed, counting a possession log without emptying it, using a hard-coded "obviously wrong" code that a seeded run had made the right one. Restore in a `finally`, not after the assertions — a failure otherwise leaves the stage rearranged for everything that follows.

Where a test genuinely cannot be written — it needs hardware, or data no fixture has — say so in the pull request and in the doc, and write the check that *can* run. "Untestable" is a claim to justify, not a default.

## Change one, change its pair

Things this project keeps in two places on purpose. Each pair has been caught out of step at least once, and none of them fails loudly.

- **A keyboard shortcut or a click gesture → the Keys reference.** `openKeysHelp()` in `commentator.php` is the only place a commentator meets all of them at once. A gesture that is not in it does not exist as far as a user is concerned — shift-click for an injury substitution needed a row there as much as it needed a handler.
- **A user-facing behaviour → its `docs/` section.** The docs are load-bearing here; see below.
- **A new declared value → the store's validator, both surfaces, and the reset list.** The line size touched `shared/possession.php`, `possession.php`, the commentator toolbar, the Studio bar, and `stage.php`, which read the ratio from the same file and would have silently stopped labelling ratios at a declared 5v5.
- **A change to the exported CSV's shape → every test that indexes it by position.** Adding a `NOTICE` row above the players broke seven assertions written as `rows[3]` and `lines[1]`. Position was never the contract; address rows by their identifier.
- **A UI change → `npm run shots`.** `docs/images/` is committed, and a shot of a layout you changed three commits ago is a document showing something that no longer exists. This has already been got wrong here: the player sheet was rebuilt and its image regenerated only when something unrelated forced a run.
- **A committed screenshot → the recipe that regenerates it.** A shot has to come out byte-identical on a second run or a diff in it means nothing. The recipe seeds a room and must clear **every channel by name** afterwards: saves are deltas, so clearing only `text` left pronouns and matchings accumulating run over run. **`scoreboard.gif` is the exception** — it captures an animation and differs on every run regardless of code, so leave it alone unless the scoreboard actually changed.

## Verification

**Measure; do not eyeball.** On a 1920×1080 canvas viewed in a window, looking at it proves nothing. Every layout claim in this project has been settled with `getBoundingClientRect()` through headless Chrome, and several confident-looking visual judgements were wrong.

- **The suite:** `npm test` (add `ADMIN_PASS=...` for the tests that change what is on air). Playwright against a running dev instance, asserting on geometry, contrast and state transitions rather than markup. Add a test whenever a defect is found — every spec in there names the regression it exists to catch.
- **The hosted URL layout is not a constant.** `<prefix>/live/overlays/` was written into every page's asset helper and into five endpoint URLs, and every one of them broke the moment this directory was served from a document root instead. Ask `Overlays\Mode` — `assetBase()` for a file, `viewUrl()` for one of this project's endpoints — and never write the path.
- **Two servers, two suites.** `npm test` drives a hosted instance; `npm run test:standalone` drives `php -S` on a throwaway tree with no UltiOrganizer above it. The second exists because `php -S` does not read `.htaccess`, so every rule that keeps `conf/` off the network exists twice — in the shipped `.htaccess` and in `app.php`'s router — and a rule written twice is a rule that will disagree with itself eventually. Both copies are tested by making the request, never by reading the code.
- **`npm run check` is what CI runs, not a copy of it.** The repository's own checks live in `tests/*.mjs` and are invoked by one npm script from both places. They began as shell inside the workflow file, which meant running them locally required copying them out of YAML — so nobody did. If you add a check, add it there.
- **A new pure spec goes in `tests/playwright.unit.config.js`.** `tests/suites.mjs` enforces it, because the failure mode is silent: a pure spec left off that list still runs locally under the hosted suite and never runs in CI at all.
- **CI proves the part that needs no instance; you are the gate for the rest.** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs PHP syntax on 8.3 and 8.4, the shared modules' CommonJS load, the pure logic specs, the standalone routing and guard suite against `php -S`, and the docs' relative links. It could now run the browser suite too — a capture renders every page with no host — and deliberately does not: a recording is real data frozen on one day, so every payload-shape assertion would pass forever, including after Live! changed the shape. That is the mock problem in better clothes. `npm test` against a real instance is what proves the contract, and a green tick here is not a green suite.
- **Run the gated third before handing back work that touches a store.** Without `ADMIN_PASS` the tests that change what is on air skip themselves — 58 of 229 at the time of writing — and nothing in CI will ever run them. `ADMIN_PASS=... npm test`.
- Syntax: `php -l <file>`
- Routes: every page should return 200 — `/s/`, `/s/<game>`, `/s/<game>/overlay`, `/c/<game>`, and `?view=live/overlays/tests/selftest`
- Behaviour: drive the real page with the Chrome DevTools Protocol and assert on the DOM, rather than reasoning about what the code should do
- Data: after any change to a query or payload shape, run the old and new versions and compare actual rows
- **Beware your own regexes.** Several "missing element" findings in this project's history were the checker failing on attribute order or on a property set by JS, not the code being wrong. When a check says something is absent, confirm it is absent.

Fixtures: `fixtures/dev-fixture.sql` (idempotent — two 28-player squads, one finished game, one live) and `fixtures/dev-score.sh` to add a goal and watch an overlay react.

## Documentation

- `docs/README.md` — index, install, URLs. Start here.
- `docs/PLAN.md` — platform, request flow, payload field names, the scoreboard itself.
- `docs/STUDIO.md` — the stage, slots, cards, show state, and the full account of what the data supports.
- `docs/COMMENTATOR.md` — the second screen, line sharing, prepared talking points (§5a), the naming/pronunciation questions, and the federation idea (§8a).
- `docs/POSTPRODUCTION.md` — adding an overlay to a game that was recorded without a switcher: alignment, anchors, and what is not solved.
- `docs/UPSTREAM.md` — the digest of asks against UltiOrganizer and Live!, one entry per ask linking to its full case in `STUDIO.md` or `COMMENTATOR.md`.
- `docs/SETUP.md` — a concept, nothing built: configurable per-rig profiles covering setup, in-game reminders and teardown. The idea worth keeping is that a checklist earns its place only where the software can *verify* an item or where getting it wrong puts something false on air; ten such items are already machine-checkable and surfaced nowhere. Its most valuable item is at teardown: how many post-production anchors this game will need, which depends on how it was scored and is unrecoverable once everyone has left.
- `docs/RELAY.md` — **a future direction, not scheduled**: whether the state could live in the browsers with a server that only relays. `STANDALONE.md` is the near-term path and is server-based on purpose. Worth reading for two things — that the existing stores are already nearly CRDTs, and the two-tier rule about which surfaces may take dependencies.
- `docs/MATCHCONTROL.md` — **built**: the score and clock store, the phone surface at `/k/<game>`, and the Studio switch that decides whether the scoreboard reads it or upstream. §0 is what exists. The rule to know before touching goal entry is that a goal is written as **the point it creates**, never as `+1` — that is what makes a retry safe, and the offline outbox rests entirely on it. It writes to this project only: UltiOrganizer's API is read-only, so a score kept here is parallel to the tournament record and never replaces it.
- `docs/DEPLOY.md` — putting a standalone installation on a domain of its own, **creating an event** (`event.php` at `/s/event` and `install/make-event.php`, both over `shared/event.php` — the payload shape exists once), **squads** (`shared/roster.php` — standalone only; hosted a squad is UltiOrganizer's and `roster.php` 404s), and **demonstration mode** (`'demo' => true`, which closes the two stores that take unauthenticated writes): `deploy.sh`, `install/standalone.htaccess`, and `install/make-config.php`. Read it before touching any of those three, and before adding a file to `conf/` that something polls as a static asset — that allow-list now exists in **three** copies (hosted `.htaccess`, standalone `.htaccess`, `app.php`) because each is read by a different server, and `tests/htaccess.mjs` fails the build when they drift.
- `docs/STANDALONE.md` — running the overlays without UltiOrganizer. **Milestones 1–3 are built**: `shared/provider.js` is the one way to read Live!, `shared/auth.php` the one place anything asks whether a request may reach air, and `app.php` a front controller for a host that has no host. Read it before adding anything that reaches for UltiOrganizer, and use `Overlays\Mode` rather than writing `/live/overlays/` into a page — that assumption was in every one of them and broke the moment this directory was served from a document root.

Keep them in sync with the code. When a doc and the code disagree, the doc is a bug — this project's docs are load-bearing, because most of what they record is *why* something is the way it is, which the code cannot say.

# Broadcast overlays for Live! by BULA

A broadcast graphics layer for Ultimate tournaments, extending [Live! by BULA](https://github.com/layoutd/live-by-bula). It turns the data an event is already keeping — score, clock, rosters, goals and assists — into graphics a video switcher can put on air, and gives the people running the broadcast somewhere to control them from.

Four surfaces, for four different jobs:

- **Scoreboard** — a broadcast bug on a transparent 1920×1080 canvas. One URL, point a browser source at it, done.
- **Studio** — a full-frame stage hosting several cards at once, plus the control page that decides what is on it.
- **Commentator** — a second screen, never on air: rosters, stats, who is on the field.

Everything reads through Live!'s public JSON API. No overlay touches the database, which is what makes this a drop-in that survives a Live! upgrade.

![A full frame, as a switcher receives it](docs/images/stage.png)

*What actually reaches the switcher: a 1920×1080 frame, transparent everywhere except the graphics. The bug sits inside a title-safe inset with a companion strip above it, and the rest of the frame is left alone — which is the point.*

*Every display state, from one real payload — score, clock, caps, timeouts, hold and break. Reproduce it on any device with `?demo=1`.*

|---|---|
| ![Score progression](docs/images/progression-card.png) | ![Summary card](docs/images/summary-card.png) |
| **Score progression** — the traditional staircase: right when the home team scores, down when the away team does. In a mixed division each step carries the gender ratio it was played at, by dash as well as colour | **Summary** — one card that works out for itself whether it is before the pull, at the half, mid-game or full time |
| ![Studio](docs/images/studio.png) | ![Commentator](docs/images/commentator-daylight.png) |
| **Studio** — what is on air, and where | **Commentator** — daylight by default, because the job happens beside a pitch |
| ![Player sheet](docs/images/player-sheet.png) | ![Commentator at night](docs/images/commentator-night.png) |
| **Player sheet** — everything Live! publishes about one player | **Night** — for a booth or an evening game |

![Play by play](docs/images/commentator-play.png)

*Play by play, on a mixed game — the line on the field, grouped into its FMP and MMP rows with the matching that needs four on top, and each player's declared pronouns beside the name about to be said, the less common sets emphasised. The gender-ratio line runs the coming points and says which ratio each side is winning on. **8 Eli Haas** went off injured — shift-click, on the field or in the picker — so he stays below the line, struck through and tagged **INJ**, cued three ways so no part of it depends on colour. Typing a shirt number pins that player's quick card below — here #1, worn by both teams, so both appear — carrying the identity line and the prepared note. Nickname, pronouns, name pronunciation and matching arrive through the team's own CSV, where every player writes their own row.*

## Features

### Scoreboard — the on-air bug

| | |
|---|---|
| Score | Live, with a flash on change, and a HOLD / BREAK tab over the scoring side |
| Score source | Per game, an operator chooses whether the scoreboard reads Live! or **match control** — this project's own scorekeeping, on a phone at the pitch. Live! caches a game for 30 seconds, so a goal is on air up to half a minute late; through match control it is about a second. The scorekeeper's page says plainly when it is *not* the source |
| Scorekeeping offline | Every press is applied on the phone at once and sent afterwards; what cannot be sent queues and retries **against this project's own server**. Safe because a goal is written as **the point it completes**, so the same point sent twice stores one goal. **It does not sync to UltiOrganizer or Live!** — their API is read-only, so there is nowhere to send it; a game kept here is a parallel score the overlay can be pointed at, and UO's own scoresheet is unaffected |
| Clean holds | HOLD becomes CLEAN HOLD when the defence never touched the disc that point — only where possession was actually being tracked |
| Break chance | A red tab while the defence has the disc, driven by whoever is tracking possession |
| On defence | A quieter standing tag, always true, shown whenever nobody is tracking possession |
| Game clock | Counts up, or down to the pool's time cap. Derived from `timer_start`, ticks locally between polls, corrected for server skew |
| Caps | Half cap amber, time cap red, with the new point cap spelled out. Dropped once the game is not running |
| Timeouts | Ticks under each name, with the half-time reset where the format has one |
| Kit colours | Entered in the Studio minutes before the pull. Neutral until both sides are set |
| Team logos | Per-team files in `logos/`, falling back to Live!'s own team photos |
| Context ribbon | Pool, round, field |
| Layout | Auto-fitting team names, `?size=compact`, four corner positions, light/dark logo plate |
| Backgrounds | Transparent by default; `?bg=green\|blue\|magenta\|black\|<hex>` for switchers that cannot key alpha |
| `?demo=1` | Walks every display state from one real payload — scheduled, live, hold, break, timeout, cap, paused, final |
| `?reload=<s>` | Meta-refresh fallback for a browser source that rasterises once and never runs timers |
| `?at=…` | Renders one deterministic frame of a stated instant and stops — the basis for adding an overlay to a game that was recorded without a switcher |

### Studio — the operator's page at `/s/`

| | |
|---|---|
| Public, read-only | Game list, fields, kick-off times and browser-source URLs without logging in. Logging in adds the controls, not the information |
| Game list | Live first, then scheduled, then final, each with field and time |
| Kit colours | A picker beside each team name on the matchup line |
| Position picker | A 3×3 map of the frame, plus Full frame and With scoreboard |
| On air | One switch per card. Several cards may be *placed* in a position; one may be *on air* |
| Displacement warning | Hovering a control that would take something off air flags the card that would lose, before the click. Nothing is ever disabled for conflict |
| Auto mode | A card shows itself at the moment it is about: 15s after a goal, 30s at the halftime cap, 45s at full time, or continuously until the first pull. Each card is offered only the moments that suit it |
| Config file | Export the whole arrangement and import it on another field — or feed it to post-production, so a recording gets the same overlay the broadcast used |
| All off air | Clears the frame in one click, keeping every position and preload intact |
| Undo | One level — the mistakes worth reversing are always the last action |
| Tournament logo | `TV_SCREEN_LOGO_PATH` in a chosen corner, kept clear of whatever else is there |
| Break chance mode | Enable it, then declare possession with **O** and **D** on the keyboard, or hand tracking to a commentator by naming their room code |
| Keyboard reference | A Keys button on every operator surface — the Studio and both commentator modes — opens the shortcut list, with the live keys inert behind it |
| Connected commentators | How many commentator pages are live on that code |

### Stage — one URL per broadcast at `/s/<game>/overlay`

| | |
|---|---|
| Single browser source | One URL for the whole broadcast, pinned to one game, so several fields can run side by side |
| Slots | Nine positions plus a full-frame takeover and a companion slot that rides with the scoreboard |
| Cards | Scoreboard, last goal, last assist, last goal + assist, top players (4 per team, at least one FMP and one MMP in mixed), and pre-game / half-time / full-time summaries with records, seeds and breaks |
| Arm then show | Every card loads and decodes before it is revealed, so nothing pops in half-drawn on air |
| Auto mode | With no configuration at all, the stage runs the scoreboard and nothing else |

### Commentator — the second screen at `/c/`

| | |
|---|---|
| Daylight first | A high-contrast light theme measured at 7:1 or better throughout, because the page is used beside a pitch. A night theme for booths, remembered per device |
| Team stats | Record, points for and against, difference, pool, standing, with deep links into the tournament site |
| Rosters | Both squads side by side, sorted by number, goals, assists, points, tournament total, or blocks |
| Player sheet | This game and the tournament, blocks and callahans where recorded, games and points per game, a game-by-game history, and the team-mate they most often score with |
| Bio round trip | Export a CSV — or Copy for Sheets, which puts the same table on the clipboard and opens a fresh Google Sheet to paste into. The players fill in their own rows, and a final TEAM row takes the team's history and achievements; import fills only what is empty here, never what the desk typed, one channel at a time. Every row and the file name say whose sheet it is, and the wrong team's file is refused with a pointer to the right panel |
| Identity fields | Nickname, pronouns, name pronunciation, captaincy, nationality, position and throwing hand — and, in mixed divisions, the FMP/MMP matching, stored as exactly those two terms — as structured fields, self-declared through the CSV or corrected at the desk, shown beside the name on the roster, the player sheet and the field view. Less common pronoun sets are emphasised — those are the ones a reading habit gets wrong — and the full line rides on hover on the field view. A prep-time review maps variant spellings onto the two common sets — or keeps any declared set (she/they, xe/xem, …) exactly as written, tweakable in place, never asked again and never mapped automatically |
| Quick cards | Type a shirt number — or click the chip — to pin that player's compact card under the lines: identity line, scoring, the prepared note. Up to two side by side; a number both teams wear pins both, labelled; Esc clears. A Keys button explains every shortcut |
| Line selection | Who is on the field, shared between two commentators through a room code |
| Mixed line assist | With matchings and the point's ratio known, the chips tint by matching (deliberately non-stereotyped colours), order tighter-quota-first, count against quota in the panel header, and a filled matching's unpicked players step aside until someone is unpicked. The point-1 ratio can be declared even before the desk is linked — kept on that screen only, replaced by the shared value the moment one exists |
| Possession | Track offence and defence with **O** and **D**; turnover counts for this point and the last |
| Blocks | A column and a sort, but only where the installation actually records them |

### Underneath

| | |
|---|---|
| Two polls | Show state and possession on a ~1s static channel; game data on Live!'s own cache life. An operator's click is instant; a break chance is never ten seconds late |
| Store-side rules | Slot and visibility rules live in the store, so no client can write an illegal frame |
| Optimistic locking | Two people on the control page cannot silently overwrite each other |
| Self-test | `tests/selftest.php` — four independently moving panels, so a switcher that fails to update can be diagnosed by *which* layer is frozen |
| Fixtures | A complete two-team tournament, idempotent, with a script to add goals and watch an overlay react |

## Requirements

A working [Live! by BULA](https://github.com/layoutd/live-by-bula) 3.0.6 installation with a published season. Live! v3 in turn requires [UltiOrganizer](https://github.com/ktolonen/ultiorganizer) 4, PHP 8.3+ and MariaDB 10.11+.

Note that Live! by BULA has its own prerequisite: its [Terms of Use](https://github.com/layoutd/live-by-bula/blob/main/Terms%20of%20Use%20-%20Live%20by%20BULA.pdf) must be signed and returned to live@beachultimate.org before use.

## Install

Unzip or clone into `live/overlays/` — beside Live!'s own code, the same way Live! is installed beside UltiOrganizer's — and make `conf/` writable by the web server. There is no build step.

Recorded a game without a switcher? [docs/POSTPRODUCTION.md](docs/POSTPRODUCTION.md) covers adding the same overlay afterwards.

Full instructions, URLs, and the reasoning behind the design: **[docs/README.md](docs/README.md)**.

## Help wanted

Two kinds of help would make more difference to this project than more features.

**Design.** The graphics work and are measured — contrast, title-safe insets, colour-blind separation, names that fit — but measured is not the same as *good*. The scoreboard bug and the cards would benefit from somebody who designs broadcast graphics for a living, and the operator and commentator interfaces from anyone who does UX. If a layout here looks amateur to you, that is useful information and I would like to hear it.

**Testing.** This has never run at a real tournament. It has never run on a Magewell Director Mini or a Yolobox at all, and the single assumption everything rests on — that a hardware switcher's browser source keeps running JavaScript — is still unverified on hardware. `tests/selftest.php` answers that in about ten seconds on the device.

If you are broadcasting an Ultimate event and willing to try it, or to run the self-test and report what happened, that is worth more than any amount of further development. Failures are the useful part: an overlay that never updated, a graphic that looked wrong on air, an instruction that made no sense at the side of a pitch.

There is also a wishlist pointed the other way: [docs/UPSTREAM.md](docs/UPSTREAM.md) collects what these overlays want from UltiOrganizer and Live! by BULA themselves — one entry per ask, with what it unlocks and a link to the full case.

Open an issue either way.

## Development

This project is built with heavy use of AI coding assistants. The conventions that keep that workable — what may not be touched, how claims are verified, and why the documentation is load-bearing rather than decorative — are written down in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which is meant for both the humans and the agents.

Two of those conventions are worth stating here, because they shape everything else. Behaviour is established by **measurement** rather than by reading the code and reasoning about it: layout claims come from `getBoundingClientRect()` in a real browser, data claims from running the query and comparing rows. And the documents under [docs/](docs/) record *why* decisions were made, including the ones that turned out to be wrong — which is the part neither a human nor a model can reconstruct from the source later.

## Tests

```
npm install
npm test                      # the suite
ADMIN_PASS=... npm test       # including the tests that change what is on air
npm run shots                 # regenerate the images above
```

Playwright, against a running dev instance rather than a mock — the payload shape is exactly the thing that has been wrong before, so a mock would agree with itself and nothing else. It uses the system Chrome (`channel: 'chrome'`), so there is no browser download and the dev dependency is three packages.

The assertions are deliberately about **geometry, contrast and state transitions** rather than markup, because that is how this code has actually failed: a companion card overlapping the scoreboard by 22px, a stage rendering below the fold in a normal window, a heading that read backwards to a screen reader, two caps that looked like bounds and bounded nothing. `expect(box.right).toBe(other.left)` is a claim about what goes on air; `expect(html).toContain('<div>')` is not.

Tests needing the Live! admin session skip themselves without `ADMIN_PASS`, and anything that writes show state restores it afterwards — the suite borrows the same files a real broadcast reads.

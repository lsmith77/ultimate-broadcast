/**
 * Standalone front controller — the overlays without UltiOrganizer.
 *
 *   app.php?view=stage
 *   app.php?view=commentator&game=702
 *
 * Ten files in this directory begin by refusing to run unless `UO_ROUTED_VIEW`
 * is defined. That guard is what makes a direct request to `commentator.php`
 * a 404 instead of a page, and hosted mode satisfies it through
 * UltiOrganizer's front controller. This is the other way to satisfy it, for a
 * host that has no UltiOrganizer — see `docs/STANDALONE.md` §2.
 *
 * WHY AN ALLOW-LIST RATHER THAN A RESOLVER
 *
 * UltiOrganizer resolves `?view=` against the filesystem, because it serves
 * hundreds of pages and cannot enumerate them: it rejects `..`, restricts the
 * characters, then confirms the resolved realpath is still inside the base
 * directory. That is the correct design for that problem and it is a design
 * whose safety rests on getting three checks right.
 *
 * This directory serves eleven pages and can name all of them. So it does.
 * A view that is not a key below cannot be reached, whatever it contains —
 * there is no traversal to defend against because no part of the request ever
 * becomes part of a path. It is a smaller thing to get right, and this is the
 * file where getting it wrong exposes the prepared notes, which are notes
 * about named people.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT INHERIT, AND THEREFORE MUST DO ITSELF
 *
 * Hosted, these pages sit behind UltiOrganizer's session, its private-event
 * check and its maintenance check. None of that exists here. What this file
 * owes them is the session; `Overlays\Auth` owes them the administrator check;
 * and the deployment owes them `conf/` being unreadable over HTTP, which the
 * shipped `.htaccess` does and which any other server must be made to do.
 * That last one is not optional and is not enforceable from PHP.
 */

/**
 * Built-in server mode.
 *
 * `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080 app.php` is a deployment `docs/STANDALONE.md` §6
 * actively suggests — a laptop at a venue with no uplink — and the built-in
 * server **does not read `.htaccess`**. Everything the shipped rules do for
 * Apache therefore has to be done here as well, or the deployment we recommend
 * is the one that leaks.
 *
 * It is not hypothetical: without this block, `conf/notes/<room>.json` is
 * served on request, and that file is the commentary desk's prepared notes —
 * notes about named people, which the `.gitignore` says "must not reach a
 * repository under any circumstances" and which have no business reaching a
 * browser either.
 *
 * Returning false hands the request back to the server to serve as a static
 * file; returning anything else means this script handled it.

/**
 * The short URLs, which exist for a video switcher's on-screen keyboard.
 *
 * Hosted, `.htaccess` rewrites these onto UltiOrganizer's front controller.
 * The built-in server reads no `.htaccess`, so the same routes are stated here
 * — and they are not a test convenience: typing
 * `index.php?view=live/overlays/scoreboard&game=702` on a switcher's on-screen
 * keyboard is the problem these URLs were introduced to solve, and a
 * standalone installation has exactly the same problem.
 *
 * Order matters the same way it does in the rewrite rules: "stage" and
 * "overlay" are names, not game ids or colours, so they are matched first.
 *
 * WHY A REDIRECT RATHER THAN AN INTERNAL REWRITE
 *
 * Apache rewrites these internally, so the browser keeps the short URL. This
 * cannot: the pages read their parameters with `filter_input(INPUT_GET, ...)`,
 * which reads the ORIGINAL request and ignores anything written into `$_GET`.
 * An internal rewrite here would set `$_GET['game']` and the scoreboard would
 * still answer "Missing or invalid ?game=".
 *
 * The alternative was changing thirty `filter_input` call sites — the parameter
 * validation on every page — to make a cosmetic difference in the address bar.
 * A redirect costs one round trip on a URL that is typed once and then lives in
 * a browser source, so it wins easily.

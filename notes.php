 * Prepared talking points about players, for the commentary position.

 *   GET  ?view=live/overlays/notes&code=K7QM4
 *        -> {"players":{"1234":{"text":"…","pronouns":"she/her","by":"Sam","at":N}},"touched":N,"writable":bool}
 *
 *   POST {"code":"K7QM4","team":304,"text":"…","by":"Sam"}
 *        -> write one TEAM's note — history, achievements, the material that
 *           belongs to nobody's row; an empty text clears it
 *
 *   POST {"code":"K7QM4","player":1234,"text":"…","nickname":"…","pronouns":"…","pronunciation":"…","pronounsok":true,"by":"Sam"}
 *        -> write one player's entry, as a DELTA: a structured-field key that
 *           is present sets the field (empty string clears it), an absent key
 *           leaves the stored value alone — so a stale page can only touch
 *           what it sends. An entry whose every channel ends up empty is
 *           deleted. `pronounsok` marks the declared pronouns as reviewed
 *           (keep-as-written); absent keeps the mark while the pronouns stand
 *           unedited, and it never survives an edited declaration.
 *
 * **Unauthenticated, like lines.php and for the same reason.** The code is a
 * namespace rather than a credential; nothing stored here reaches a viewer, so
 * requiring the Live! admin session would hand broadcast control to somebody who
 * only wants to prepare notes with a colleague. See shared/notes.php for the caps
 * that come with that decision, and docs/COMMENTATOR.md section 5a for why the
 * room is keyed by code alone rather than by game and code.
 *
 * NO GAME ID ANYWHERE. A note about a player is worth the same in the final as in
 * the quarter, so it is not scoped to a fixture. That also means this endpoint has
 * nothing game-shaped to validate, which is deliberate: an unauthenticated
 * endpoint cannot be given a database lookup to do on demand, and lines.php shows
 * what happens when a cap leans on an id nobody checked.

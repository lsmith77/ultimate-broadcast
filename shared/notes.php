 *     "touched": 1787420000 }
 *
 * `teams` holds one note per TEAM — history, achievements, the material that
 * belongs to nobody's row — arriving through the bio round trip's TEAM row or
 * typed at the desk, under the same expiry and caps discipline as everything
 * else here.
 *
 * Besides the free-text note, an entry may carry three STRUCTURED fields —
 * `nickname`, `pronouns`, `pronunciation` (see FIELDS) — the answers a
 * commentator looks up at speed rather than reads out, shown beside the name
 * instead of inside the note. They arrive through the bio round trip, where the
 * player fills in their own row (which is what makes pronouns acceptable to hold
 * at all: self-declared or absent, never guessed — docs/COMMENTATOR.md section
 * 5), or are typed at the desk. Non-empty values only; an entry exists while any
 * of its four channels has content.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `docs/COMMENTATOR.md` section 5 argues that the right home for
 * what a commentator says about a player is `uo_player_profile`, self-declared and
 * published through the existing `public` opt-in. That remains true and this does
 * not replace it. But at a smaller tournament the commentary position exists only
 * for the finals, and the way material actually reaches it is that somebody asks
 * the two teams for something to say and is handed it an hour before the pull.
 * There is no UltiOrganizer surface for that, and there will not be one before the
 * game starts. So the commentator types it here.
 *
 * KEYED BY CODE, NOT BY GAME, which is the one place this store's shape differs
 * from `Lines` and the difference is the point. A line selection is worthless five
 * minutes after the point ends; a note about a player is worth exactly as much in
 * the final as it was in the quarter. Keying by game would make a commentary desk
 * retype everything each round, which is the surest way to have them stop doing
 * it. So the room here is the code alone, and a desk that keeps its code keeps its
 * notes for the tournament.
 *
 * That also removes the trap `Lines::prune()` fell into. There, rooms are bounded
 * per game AND overall, because bounding per game alone bounds nothing: any
 * positive integer is an acceptable game id, so a caller walking `game=1, 2, 3 …`
 * collects a fresh allowance every time. Here there is no game in the key, so
 * there is one flat directory and one bound that actually holds.
 *
 * UNAUTHENTICATED, like `lines.php` and for the same reason: the code is a
 * namespace, not a credential, and nothing stored here reaches a viewer. The cost
 * of that decision is everything below — a length cap on the text, a cap on
 * players per room, a cap on rooms, and expiry.
 *
 * THIS IS PERSONAL DATA ABOUT NAMED PEOPLE, WRITTEN BY SOMEBODY ELSE, which is
 * what separates it from every other store here and from the self-declared profile
 * fields section 5 asks for upstream. Three consequences are load-bearing rather
 * than decorative: `conf/` is default-closed in the overlays' `.htaccess` so these
 * files are not servable, the directory is gitignored so nothing reaches a
 * repository, and notes EXPIRE — see STALE_SECONDS. A note is scaffolding for one
 * broadcast, not a record anybody is keeping.
 *
 * See docs/COMMENTATOR.md section 5a.

     * The page already filters, but it decided that from a poll that may be
     * seconds old; enforcing it here means a partner writing during the preview
     * cannot have their note overwritten by an import that never saw it.
     *
     * `$team` is the TEAM row's note, applied under the same lock and the same
     * fill-only-what-is-empty rule: ['team' => id, 'text' => '...'], or null.

/**
 * Operator-declared possession, for break chance and clean holds.
 *
 * UltiOrganizer records no possession changes at all — no turnover table, no
 * block timestamps usable for it (docs/STUDIO.md section 3.4). So a break chance
 * cannot be derived; it can only be declared. This is the store behind that
 * declaration, and docs/STUDIO.md section 3.5 is the argument for why it is a
 * bridge rather than the destination.
 *
 * **An append-only log keyed by score, not a mutable flag.** That choice is the
 * whole design, and it is what makes the thing correct rather than merely
 * working:
 *
 *   { "rev": 7, "enabled": true, "game": 702,
 *     "events": [ {"score":"9-6","d":1,"t":1787420000} ] }
 *
 * Each event carries the score at which it was made. A reader filters by the
 * score it is currently displaying, which gives three properties for free:
 *
 *   - **A point boundary resets possession without anyone resetting it.** A goal
 *     changes the score, no event matches the new score, and possession reads as
 *     offence again. There is no "clear on score" message to lose, and no window
 *     in which a stale BREAK CHANCE tab can survive into the next point — the
 *     single most likely way this feature could put something untrue on air.
 *   - **Clean holds become answerable after the fact.** "Did the defence ever
 *     have the disc during the point that just ended?" is a question about the
 *     PREVIOUS score, and the log still holds it. A mutable flag would have been
 *     overwritten by then.
 *   - **No races between the two pollers.** The Studio writes and the scoreboard
 *     reads on independent timers; with a log there is no read-modify-write to
 *     interleave, and a reader that misses a poll misses nothing.
 *
 * Written by the Studio through possession.php (admin-gated) and read by the
 * scoreboard straight off disk as a static file, on the ~1s channel — a break
 * chance is worthless ten seconds late.

     *     appeared on game 702's scoreboard, which happened to also be at 8-6.

     * Keyed by game, none of those are possible to write, which is worth more

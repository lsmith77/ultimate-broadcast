/**
 * Where a payload comes from.
 *
 * Every page here reads the same handful of things — one game, the game list,
 * a team's roster, a player's history, the event's reference data and Live!'s
 * config — and until now each page built those URLs and handled their errors
 * itself. Eighteen entity reads across four files, and **two** copies of the
 * response contract: one in `shared/tracking.js` and a second in `index.php`,
 * which is the duplication `tracking.js` was written to end and did not reach.
 *
 * This is that read side, once. A caller says what it wants, not how to ask.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEAM AND NOT JUST A TIDY-UP
 *
 * `docs/STANDALONE.md` proposes running these overlays without UltiOrganizer,
 * where the same questions are answered from local files instead of the API.
 * The rule there is **one renderer, one payload shape, two providers** — so
 * this is the joint that a second provider would plug into. Nothing above it
 * learns which one it is talking to.
 *
 * That is also why the shape it returns is Live!'s, warts included. A provider
 * that tidied the payload would create a second contract for every consumer to
 * branch on, and `docs/PLAN.md` already lists the field names that have caught
 * people out (`teams.hometeam`, not `awayteam`).
 *
 * Loaded both by a browser page and by the test runner; see shared/stoppage.js
 * for why it publishes to `window` and `module.exports` alike.

     * 14th minute is a recording of the 14th minute whenever you play it, and a
     * test asserting on it cannot go stale overnight. Pass `rebase: 'run'` for
     * a clock that starts from the captured moment and then advances, which is
     * what a demo wants and a test does not.

     * This is the third time this project has manufactured a `timer_start` —
     * `shared/demo.js` does it because fixture 702 has none, and the
     * post-production frame does it to draw one deterministic frame. Third time
     * is where it stops being a coincidence.

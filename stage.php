 * One full-frame transparent surface for the whole broadcast. The switcher points
 * at this once and never changes; what appears on it is decided by the show state
 * (conf/show.json), which the Studio UI writes.
 *
 * Two independent polls, and the split is the point:
 *
 *   show state   conf/show.json, static, ~1s   — an operator click must feel instant
 *   game data    ?view=live/api, cached        — the numbers, 10-30s behind at worst
 *
 * The show-state read deliberately does NOT go through UltiOrganizer's front
 * controller. At one second that would be a database connection and a session per
 * second, per stage; conf/ is web-reachable so the file is read directly.

       `frame`  an iframe onto an existing overlay page. The scoreboard is
                already a complete, self-contained overlay — re-implementing it
                inside the stage would duplicate several hundred lines and give
                the two copies room to drift. It polls the API itself.

       `inline` rendered by the stage from the game payload it already polls.
                Cheaper for small cards, and the only option for anything that

     * **Nothing supplies this today, and the obvious candidate is not it.**
     * UltiOrganizer models gender ratio only for printed scoresheets
     * (`cust/wfdf/pdfscoresheet.php`, which detects a mixed division by matching
     * the word "mixed" in its name and prints ratio rules); it never
     * records which players are which. `uo_player_profile.gender` exists, but it
     * is a self-declared F/M/**O** profile field behind a privacy opt-in
     * (`user/playerprofile.php:247-269`) — so it cannot answer for a player who
     * selected Other, may be withheld entirely, and is personal data rather than
     * a roster designation. Reading it as a matching would be both a category
     * error and unreliable. No Live! entity exposes it either.
     *
     * So `matching` arrives only if some future roster field supplies it, and
     * until then this returns null for everyone and the balanced split never
     * engages — the same adapt-at-runtime rule the BLOCKS column follows.
     *
     * Only `FMP` and `MMP` are accepted. Not F/M/O: those are the values of a
     * personal-identity field, and mapping them onto a matching is the category
     * error this whole comment exists to prevent — "O" in particular has no
     * matching at all, so there is nothing to map it to. A source that wants to
     * supply matchings must say FMP or MMP.

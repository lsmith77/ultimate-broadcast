/**
 * The specs that need neither a browser nor a running instance.
 *
 * Everything in `shared/` that decides something is a pure function, tested
 * directly (AGENTS.md) — the ratio and its line sizes, the line picker's
 * grouping, declared values, and the CSV round trip. None of them opens a page.
 *
 * They are split out with a config of their own because the main one has a
 * `globalSetup` that seeds a live instance over HTTP, and a `channel: 'chrome'`
 * that expects a browser. Neither exists in continuous integration: these
 * overlays run inside an UltiOrganizer installation with Live! by BULA, which
 * is third-party software distributed under a signed Terms of Use and cannot be
 * checked out by a public workflow. See `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
 *
 * So this is not the whole suite and does not pretend to be. It is the part
 * that can be proved on every push, and it happens to be the part carrying the
 * rules a defect would be quietest in — an off-by-one in a quota, a ratio
 * shortened wrongly, an import overwriting a note somebody typed.
 *
 * The browser suite remains `npm test`, run locally against a real instance.

/**
 * Build a tree that genuinely has no UltiOrganizer in it.
 *
 * The first version of the standalone tests ran `php -S` against the working
 * copy and asserted "admin gating without Live!" — which proved nothing, because
 * `live/vendor/autoload.php` is two directories up from `shared/auth.php` in a
 * hosted checkout. `Auth::isHosted()` was returning **true** the whole time, so
 * the tests were exercising the hosted path under a standalone name.
 *
 * So the tree is copied somewhere with no host above it. That is the only way to
 * make the detection in `Auth::isHosted()` answer the way it would on a bare PHP
 * server, and the detection is the thing under test.
 *
 * `conf/` is synthesised rather than copied. The suite has to prove that
 * prepared notes are unreachable, and doing that with real notes would mean
 * copying notes about real people into a temp directory to prove they are
 * private. A fixture says the same thing and says it deterministically.
